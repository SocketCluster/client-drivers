# Curated list of clients for SocketCluster

This is the list of SocketCluster client drivers for various languages and/or operating systems.

If you wrote an open source SC client and would like to add it to this list, you should submit a PR with
the name of your client, GitHub repo URL, language/platform and the original author's GitHub username (follow the convention).

Note that the official JavaScript socketcluster-client offers a number of features - Third-party clients
may not necessarily support all these features - For this reason, we think it's important to classify
clients into different levels based on what features they offer.
Note that each level builds on top of the previous one; so a client cannot be considered L3 unless it implements all the required features of both L1 and L2.

The levels are:

- L1: Support for emitting and listening to remote events (without automatic reconnection).
- L2: Automatic reconnection
- L3: Pub/sub
- L4: Authentication (JWT)

Feedback on existing clients is welcome.
